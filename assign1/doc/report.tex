    \chapter{Introduction}

    \paragraph{}This project intends to show and evaluate the effect of processor performance when accessing large amounts of data, performing the same instructions multiple times. In this study, the product of two matrices was used as the base calculation.

    \paragraph{}Also, a comparison of how different programming languages interact with memory and impact the processor speed is shown. It is important to highlight that these tests were performed on a single core, so no parallelism optimizations are made.

    \paragraph{}Finally, performance measures were made using the Performance API (PAPI), which will be analyzed and discussed in further detail.

    \section{Problem Description}

    \paragraph{}The problem used to evaluate the performance was the matrix multiplication. It was chosen because the amount of instructions does not impact performance tremendously, with the greatest bottleneck being memory access.

    \paragraph{}That way, we can measure more truthfully how much time does the processor spend accessing memory, and the impact that cache hits and misses have on a program.

    \paragraph{}Even though the main intention is to measure memory access performance, we also could see how some improvements in the algorithms used could make the processing time differ.
